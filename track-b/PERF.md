# Track B: performance log

The independent development repository is not the official submission. Board run IDs and official K values must be recorded by the official integrator after verified promotions.

| Step | Change | Board run ID | T (s) | M (MB) | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Organizer Python reference | Not submitted here | 56.35 | 2,200 | Not measured here |
| 1 | Selective postings plus token-ID tape, exact phrase verification | Pending official run | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2 | Shared deduplicated token automaton for high-frequency phrases | Pending official run | Pending | Pending | Pending |

## Local, non-scoring evidence (synthetic inputs)

On the same in-chat Linux host and 100,000-document/20,000-query synthetic workload (75,307,568 input document bytes), baseline wall time was 22.97 s and peak RSS 205,608 KiB. The automaton variant took 3.05 s and peak RSS 206,108 KiB, with identical SHA-256 output (`ebe9a652d36670f1fa07f61a0e0121dbdac27c34cc289ab4ec86418f8abb097a`). This is a 7.53x local speedup on this synthetic workload, not an organizer benchmark.

On a separate 250,000-document/50,000-query synthetic workload (188,596,118 document bytes), the initial automaton crossover took 12.81 s with peak RSS 505,532 KiB. A measured 500-document posting threshold improved this to 6.90 s with peak RSS 509,272 KiB on the same input and identical SHA-256. These inputs differ from the official generator and must not be used as official scores.

The 500-document crossover also reduced the 100,000-document synthetic workload to 2.74 s with 206,400 KiB peak RSS, again retaining the exact prior output digest. Threshold sweeps on the 250,000-document synthetic input measured 7.22 s at 0, 7.42 s at 250, 6.80 s at 500 and 10.95 s at 1,000; these are host-local timings, not board scores, and the chosen threshold remains subject to official-corpus verification.

## Luna integration validation, October 30, 2026

- Candidate source: `sd-tb` HEAD `f5a81b9` (includes the common-phrase automaton). Previous official Track B candidate remains in parent commit `f100d67b58f81ca3ebec4833bb4337a0e0893f04` for rollback.
- Official seed-1 full, sample, and tiny outputs, plus seed-2 sample, match the organizer reference exactly. The independent differential suite passed seven random seeds, the worked example, and common-phrase/duplicate/suffix cases.
- Official Dockerfile check passed. Offline build produced an 81 MB image. Full seed-1 sandbox check passed with expected SHA-256 `f86973c210228141bcb6f1f1b10188ad2a9b65f71e7cd7cf4590b38de4e80927`.
- Local full-seed-1 check time including startup improved from 17.43 s to 15.67 s (about 10.1%); local cgroup peak was 420,638,720 bytes versus 420,597,760 bytes for the baseline. These are local measurements, not scoring-box results.
- Board run IDs: none; registration is pending. No official score claimed.
